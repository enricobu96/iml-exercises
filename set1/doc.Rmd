## Problem 1


These taks are solved using Python with the following libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `npf`.

### Task a and Task b

*Task a* and *Task b* are trivial, the code is not reported as asked in grading instructions. After dataset loading, though, the dataframe obtained has the following `shape`: `458 rows × 103 columns`.

### Task c

With regards to *Task c*, applying the `describe()` function gave a dataframe with `shape` equals to `8 rows x 101 columns`; the rows coincide with the typical describe variables:

- count
- mean
- std
- min
- 25% 
- 50%
- 75%
- max

Then, I applied the function `pairplot` from seaborn library:
```python
sns.pairplot(npf, hue='class4', vars=npf.columns[2:12], kind='reg')
```
With the following result:

Secondarily, I applied the function `boxplot` from seaborn library:
```python
sns.boxplot(x='class2', y='CS.mean', data=npf)
```
With the following result:

![Result of first boxplot function](img/second_graph.png){width=250px}

Finally, I created a new qualitative variable as asked. The `describe` command reports a number of 458 *event days*, and the last boxplot function (`sns.boxplot(x='class2', y='CS.mean', data=npf)`) returns this output:

![Result of second boxplot function](img/third_graph.png){width=250px}

Coming to the personal implementation of histograms, I used `matplotlib` to plot four histograms on quantitative variables with different number of bins. The following code
```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, sharey=True, sharex=True, tight_layout=True)
axs[0][0].hist(npf['T168.mean'], bins=10)
axs[0][1].hist(npf['RHIRGA672.mean'], bins=6)
axs[1][0].hist(npf['O3168.mean'], bins=16)
axs[1][1].hist(npf['NOx336.mean'], bins=6)
```

plots these four histograms:

\newpage

Doing other exploratory analysis on the data, I found out that many of the variables have little-to-no variance, while there are mainly three of them that have a huge variance in the dataset; these variables are:

- PAR
- NET
- GLOB
- SWS

This phenomenon can be seen in the following pie chart:

\newpage

## Problem 2

### Task a

I used `numpy` and `pandas` in order to create the three sets; I used the following function in order to calculate them as requested (note: `np` stands for `numpy` and `pd` stands for `pandas`):

```python
def create_dataset(n):
    x = np.random.uniform(low=-3, high=3, size=n)
    eps = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=0.4, size=n)
    y = []
    for i in range(0, len(x)):
        y.append((1+x[i]-(x[i]**2)/2) + eps[i])
    d = {'x':x,'y':y}
    return pd.DataFrame(d)
```

Then, I called the function for three times:
```python
training = create_dataset(20)
validation = create_dataset(20)
test = create_dataset(1000)
```

### Task b and Task c

I implemented from scratch OLS functions; these are the following:

```python
def transform_x(x, degree):
    X = []
    for xi in x:
        row = [xi**d for d in range(0,degree+1)]
        X.append(row)
    return X

def ols(x, y, deg):
    X = np.matrix(transform_x(x, deg))
    betas = -np.matmul(
      np.matmul(np.linalg.inv(np.matmul(X.transpose(), X)), 
      X.transpose()), y
      )
    return betas

def f(x, betas):
    y = betas[0]
    for i in range(1,len(betas)):
        y+=betas[i]*(x**i)
    return -y
```

I then applied these functions with the following code:
```python
degrees = range(0,11)
for degree in degrees:
    betas = ols(training['x'], training['y'], degree)
    line_x = np.linspace(start=-3, stop=3, num=256)
    line_y = np.array([f(xi, betas) for xi in line_x])
    plt.scatter(training['x'], training['y'])
    plt.plot(line_x, line_y)
    plt.show()
```

Respectively, in the first code block the first function transforms the array x into the input matrix $\bold{X}$, used to fitting the polynomial (cfr. lecture slides). The function `ols` fits the polynomial given `x` the previous transformed matrix, `y` the targets vector and `deg` the degree of the polynomial. `f` then applies the function over a point `x`.
In the second code block these functions are applied, and at the same time data is plotted.

In order to calculate the MSE I used the following code:

```python
def calculate_mse(degree, betas, tr):
    pred = []
    for i in range(0, len(tr)):
        pred.append(f(tr['x'][i], betas))
    mse = np.sum((tr['y']-pred)**2)
    mse/=len(tr)
    return mse

mses = []
for degree in degrees:
    betas = ols(training['x'], training['y'], deg=degree)
    mses.append(calculate_mse(degree, betas, training))
```

This code calculates the MSE with the function `calculate_mse` for every degree from 0 to 10. I applied the same code for Task C, just substituting `training` variable with `validation` and `test`.

I'm not reporting every graph due to brevity, but these are the two graphs for, respectively, degree=1 and degree=10 on the training set.

![Function on training set with degree=1](img/deg1.png){width=300px}
![Function on training set with degree=10](img/deg10.png){width=300px}

The MSE results are reported in the end of this exercise's section.

### Task D and Task E

In order to calculate the cross-validation loss I used the following code:

```python
from copy import deepcopy

tv_combined = training.append(validation).reset_index()

def cv_split(tosplit, folds):
    split = []
    copy = deepcopy(tosplit).to_numpy()
    for i in range(0, folds):
        t = []
        while len(t) < int(len(tosplit) / folds):
            toremove = np.random.randint(0, len(copy))
            t.append([copy[toremove][1], copy[toremove][2]])
            copy = np.delete(copy, toremove, 0)
        split.append(t)
    return split

splits = cv_split(tv_combined, 10)
for degree in range(0,10):
    cv = 0
    for i in range(0, 10):
        validat_set = pd.DataFrame(splits[i], columns=['x','y'])
        train_set = pd.DataFrame(columns=['x','y'])
        for j in range(0,10):
            if(j!=i):
                sp = pd.DataFrame(splits[j], columns=['x','y'])
                train_set = train_set.append(sp, ignore_index=True)
        
        min_mse = float('inf')
        betas = ols(training['x'], training['y'], deg=degree)
        mse = calculate_mse(degree, betas, train_set)
        cv+=mse
        if mse < min_mse:
            min_mse = mse
            min_mse_index = i
    cv/=10
```

The `cv_split` function splits the data into `folds` folds, and returns the splits as a list. Then, I used the function and I computed the cross validation loss for every degree from 0 to 10; I got the best result with a polynomial with degree equal to five (cv loss equal to 0.109). The other results are reported in the table in the section below.

### Table of results

### Task F

Using the table constructed, it is pretty clear that the best models are the polynomials with degree equal to 3 and equal to 4; they both have, in fact, the lowest cross validation loss and MSE for the training+validation set (calculated on the test set).

## Problem 3

### Task A and Task B

I chose Ridge as the other regression model implemented, though it is not so much different from simple linear regression for a dataset like this (there's no high dimensionality of data, since there are only 22 columns and 7590 rows).
I implemented these methods using the `scikit-learn` library. I'm not reporting the entire code due to brevity, but it is pretty similar to the regression example below:

```python
training_set = bcnp.sample(n=100)
test_set = pd.concat([bcnp, training_set]).drop_duplicates(keep=False)

# linear regression
reg = LinearRegression().fit(
  training_set[training_set.columns.difference(['Next_Tmax'])],
  training_set['Next_Tmax']
  )
y_pred = reg.predict(
  test_set[test_set.columns.difference(['Next_Tmax'])]
  )
rmse = np.sqrt(
  mean_squared_error(test_set['Next_Tmax'], y_pred)
  )
y_pred_t = reg.predict(
  training_set[test_set.columns.difference(['Next_Tmax'])]
  )
rmse_train = np.sqrt(
  mean_squared_error(training_set['Next_Tmax'], y_pred_t)
  )
```

For each model I calculated the RMSE both on test and train set; the results are reported in the table at the end of this exercise's section.

### Task C

I implemented the 10-fold cross-validation losses joining the code from Exercise 2 and the code here above. Also in this case, the code is pretty similar to the regression example below:

```python
kf = KFold(n_splits=10)

cv = 0
for tr, val in kf.split(training_set):
    reg = LinearRegression().fit(
      training_set.iloc[tr][training_set.columns.difference(
        ['Next_Tmax'])], training_set.iloc[tr]['Next_Tmax']
        )
    y_pred = reg.predict(
      training_set.iloc[val][training_set.columns.difference(['Next_Tmax'])])
    mse = mean_squared_error(training_set.iloc[val]['Next_Tmax'], y_pred)
    cv+=mse
cv/=10
```

The results are reported in the table at the end of this exercise's section as well.

### Table of results

| Regressor | RMSE on test set | RMSE on training set | Cross validation loss |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linear regression | 1.8698695351417394 | 1.1616132699948303 | 2.365633087039427 |

| Random Forest | 1.7152949723559454 | 0.5578841187917046 | 2.264977390000001 |
| SVM | 3.211369069051392 | 3.014713257799681 | 11.058880968944521 |

### Task D

As I can see from the results, the best regressor over all is random forest, since both RMSE on test set and cross validation loss are very low.
The RMSE on training data is lower in every examined case; this was quite predictable, since it's clear that the model trained on the training set is not perfectly suitable also for data on the test set. It's a good sign, though, that for the most part of the regressor it's lower but not too much; this means that a correct tradeoff between bias and variance has been found.
In order to make these models perform better, a good idea is to tweak the hyperparameters. I used, in fact, the models in a plain fashion, but more work can be done modifying general parameters like regularization strenght, or more specific ones like the maximum depth of the regression trees for the simple regression tree and the random forest models.

## Problem 4

### Task a

![Curves: x-axis is the flexibility, y-axis are the "hypotetical values"](img/diagram_measures.png){width=250px}

#### Explanation

- **Irreducible error**: the irreducible error is a constant and it's always lower than the test MSE.

- **Squared bias and Variance**: known for the "bias-variance tradeoff" issue, the variance increases when the model becomes more flexible, while the bias decreases. This happens because a more flexible model is a function that better fits the observations, hence if one or more points are different on another training set, the function won't be able to fit them as well, and then the variance gets higher; at the same time, since the bias is how far the estimated value is from the real value, a function that tends to perfectly fit the observation has bias tending to zero.

- **Training and Test MSE**: as said, a more flexible model is a function that better fits the observations; since the observations come from the training set, it's trivial that the training MSE get lower with more flexibility. For the same reason, the test MSE tends to decrease (though it never gets lower than the irreducible error) since the "best tradeoff" is found, and then it starts increasing.

### Task b



## Problem 5

### Task a

We know that $MSE = E[(\hat{\beta} −\beta)^2] = bias^2 + variance$, and we know that the generalization error for the OLS regression is $$\frac{\sum_{i\in test}^{m}(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2}{m}$$ for $m$ number of samples in the test set. Since $y_i$ are actually observations in the test set, the last formula is exactly the variance of the model, that is $L_{test}$. Thus, since $MSE = bias^2 + variance$, bias has to be equal to zero, and then $L_{test}$ is an unbiased estimate of the generalization error for the OLS regression.

### Task b

We know that $$ E[L_{train}] = E\left [\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\hat{\beta}^T\bar{\bold{x}}_i)^2\right ]$$ and, since it's biased, it is equal to $$\left (1-\frac{1}{n}\right )\sigma^2$$
$E[L_{test}]$, on the other hand, corresponds with the variance, i.e. $\sigma^2$. It's trivial to see then that $$ \left (1-\frac{1}{n}\right )\sigma^2\leq\sigma^2$$

### Task c

The result of task b says that the expectation of the train MSE is at most equal to the test MSE, but it's usually lower. This relates to the generalization problem in machine learning since it means that a tradeoff has to be found between bias and variance so that the model is neither too fitting to training data (overfitting), nor too general (underfitting).
